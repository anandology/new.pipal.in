title:
  Practical Machine Learning

brief:
  The art of building data-driven Machine Learning applications.

description: |

  One of the common pain points that we have come across in big
  organisations is the last-mile delivery of data science applications.
  One common delivery vehicle is to create dashboards (BI). But the one, thatâ€™s very useful and neglected more often than not, is to create APIs and provide seamless integration with other applications within the company. This requires you to have a basic understanding of machine learning, server-side programming and front-end application. 

  In this workshop, you would learn how to build a seamless end-to-end data driven application - Data Exploration, Machine Learning Model, RESTful API and Web Application - to solve a business prediction problem.

audience: |
  **A programmer but not a data science practioner:**
  A programmer with experience in server-side or front-end development
  and maybe has some familiarity with doing data analysis. You could be looking to transition in to building data driven products or a create a richer product experience with data.

  **A data science practioner but not a programmer:**
  A data science with some experience in doing data analysis, preferably in a scripting language (R/Python/Scala), but wants to get a deeper and a more applied perspective on creating data driven products.

prerequisites: |
  Participants should be comfortable with Python programming language and have prior experience with using Python for Data Science.

  - Deploy your ML Service - localhost API
  
  ### Session 10: Deploy to cloud

  - Get started with cloud server setup
  - Deploy your ML service as cloud API
  - Deploy your dashboard as cloud service


  ### Session 11: Repeatable ML as a Service

  - Setting up periodic tasks
  - Scheduling re-training of model every day

  ### Session 12: Practice Session & Wrap-up

  - Best practices in building ML service 
  - Challenges in managing ML in production 
  - Where to go from here

duration: 3 days
participants: 30 or less

format: |
  This is a hands-on workshop and the participants
  will build and deploy end-to-end ML application.
  There will be emphasis on actual building and will
  be roughly 70% coding and 30% theory.

  The duration for this workshop is 3-days. Each day
  will have 4 sessions each.

infrastructure: |
  We will be using Python data stack for the workshop.
  Please install Ananconda for Python 3.5 for the
  workshop.
