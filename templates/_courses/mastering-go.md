title: Mastering Go

brief:
  A deep-dive to master the Go programming language.

description: |
  Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write reliable network programs effortlessly. No wonder, it is becoming the goto language for building distributed systems.

  This hands-on workshop is a deep-dive to master the Go programming language.

objectives: |
  At the end of the workshop, youâ€™ll be able to:
  *  Understand the fundamentals of the Go programming language
  * Build concurrent applications using Go
  * Understand the best practices of Go in production

audience: |
  A software developer with interest in building server-side applications in Go, looking for deeper understanding of concurrency patterns, and best practices of building scalable applications.

prerequisites: |
  This workshop is designed for software developers with at least couple of years of development experience. Prior exposure to Go programming language would be useful, but is not required.

duration: 3 days
participants: 12 or less

format: |
  The suggested duration of the course is 3 days.
  
  This is an interactive course and it is suggested to limit the number of participants to 12 or less for it to be effective.
  
  The class time is spent on live demonstration of concepts using examples and hands-on programming exercises. Participants typically spend about 3 hours each day solving programming exercises.
  
  Reading material will be provided along with practice problems and references.
  
infrastructure: |
  * All the participants are required to have Go 1.12+ preinstalled on their computers.
  * It is recomended to use a Unix computer (GNU/Linux or Mac OS X).
