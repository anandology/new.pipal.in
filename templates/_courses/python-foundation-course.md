title:
  Python Foundation Course

brief:
  A hands on course for mastering the essentials of Python programming language and using it to solve real-world problems.

audience: |
  The course is designed for professional software developers.
  
  This course assumes that the participants already have experience with some programming language. Prior exposure to Python is not required.
  
prerequisites: |
  *This is not an introduction to programming course.* Participants should already be familiar with the basic concepts of programming like variables, assignment, functions, loops, arrays etc.

outline: |
  
  ### Getting Started
  
  Quick introduction to Python programming language, including basic data types, functions, methods, modules, conditionals and loops.
  
  ### Working with Data
  
  Introduction to Python’s powerful datastuctures including, lists and dictionaries. Also covers list comprehensions, processing text and working with files.
  
  ### Modules
  
  Introduction to Python module system, importing modules, writing custom modules, documenting code using docstrings and installing third-party modules. This section concludes with a tour of Python standard library covering modules related to file system handling, downloading stuff from web, JSON and working with APIs.
  
  ### Classes and Objects
  
  Introduction to object-oriented programming with Python. Describes how classes offer a different programming model. Covers writing classes, object creation, inheritance and exception handling.
  
  ### Testing Python Programs
  
  Introduction to automated testing using unittest and py.test modules.

duration: 3–4 days
participants: 12 or less

format: |
  The suggested duration of the course is 3 days. The duration can be extended to 4 days to cover some
  additional topics, if required.
  
  This is an interactive course and it is suggested to limit the number of participants to 12 or less for it
  to be effective.
  
  The class time is spent on live demonstration of concepts using examples and hands-on programming
  exercises. Participants typically spend about 3 hours each day solving programming exercises.
  
  Reading material will be provided along with practice problems and references.
  
  All the topics covered in the class will recorded as IPython notebook and shared with all the
  participants at the end of the each day of the training.

infrastructure: |
  The class room will require a video projector and a white board.
  
  A computer with internet connection is required for each participant. The computers must have
  Python 3.5 preinstalled.
