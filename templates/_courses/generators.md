  Generators Inside Out

brief:
  A hands-on workshop that provides in-depth introduction to generators in Python.

description: |
  This is a hands-on workshop that provides in-depth introduction to generators in Python.
  
  Using lot of examples and exercises, this workshop introduces the idea of generators in depth with emphasis on the new style of programming that generators makes possible. Weâ€™ll also see how to build a cooperative multi-threading library using generators and explore the new async and await constructs of Python 3.

audience: |
  This course is targeted at experienced Python programmers who would like learn about using generators effectively in their applciations.
  
prerequisites: |
  This course assumes a working knowledge of Python programming. This course is *not* recommended for programmers who are new to Python.

outline: |
  
  ### Introduction to generators
  
  Introductions to the concept of generators. Understanding lazy evaluation and creating data flow pipelines using generators. Using generators to process larges datasets effectively.
  
  ### Generators as coroutines
  
  Using generators as coroutines to achive cooperative multitasking.
  
  ### Coroutines with async and await
  
  Using new `awat` and `async` constructs introduced in Python 3.5 for build coroutines.
  
  ### Building a async library
  
  Understanding how libraries like asyncio works by building a simple async library from scratch.
