title:
  Python Decorators Demystified

brief:
  Learn functional programming concepts to build libraries and frameworks with beautiful APIs.

description: |  
  Decorators are one of the elegant features of the Python programming language. They are heavily used in modern libraries and frameworks to create elegant APIs. 
  
  This workshop introduces Python decorators starting from the functional programming concepts to writing practical decorators using lot of examples and exercises. 
  
  At the end of the workshop, you'll be able to:
  - understand how decorators work
  - appreciate how decorators are applied in the libraries and frameworks that you use
  - build beautiful abstractions using decorators
  - improve code readability and reusability using techniques learnt
