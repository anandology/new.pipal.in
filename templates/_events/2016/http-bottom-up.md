  HTTP Bottom Up is a two-day hands-on workshop to explore everything that happens behind the scenes of your favorite web framework.
  
  This workshop explores building web applications starting all the way from bare sockets, without using any framework. Even though this is not the most production way to build web applications, this exercise will give a chance to observe and understand everything that happens behind the scenes of any web application.
  
  After the course, the participants will be in a better position to architect web applications and reason about their performance and scaliabity.
  
  The workshop uses Python 3 for all the examples and exercises.
