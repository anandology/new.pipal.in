brief:
  Hands-on workshop that takes you though everything that you need to know to design great RESTful APIs.

description: |
  Representational state transfer (REST) a simple architectural style based on the priniciples of HTTP for building modern web applications and APIs. This hands-on workshop takes you though everything that you need to know to design great RESTful APIs.

  During the workshop, the participants will understand the key concepts behind RESTful APIs, critically examine some of the popular APIs, design an API from scratch and see how APIs evolve. We’ll also take couple of popular APIs, rip them apart and design a better version of them. Partipants will be divided into smaller groups to allow discussions and most of the time is spent in thinking about the APIs and discussions.

  By the end of this course, you’ll have good understanding of RESTful APIs and start judging every API that you encounter.
