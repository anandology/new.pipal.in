Confucius once famously said "I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I
understand.”. Anand epitomizes this adage in his training. A very principled approach to
learning Python using a hands-on approach. [...] The class sizes are small. This gives ample
opportunity to have one-on-one with the instructor and get the questions clarified immediately
and satisfactorily. No one would feel let behind . A lot of exercises during the workshop meant
that the concepts were drilled home by the time workshop got over. By the end of the workshop,
we were ready to build a simple blog engine ! Anand is an awesome instructor with lots of
interesting stories. Don’t miss out the stories during tea and lunch break :) Also, did I say this
instilled in me enough Python to go and talk at three PyCons around the world within 6
months?
