I recently had a chance to be part of an "Advanced Python Training" workshop with Anand.
Without a doubt, I can say that he has been one of the best trainers I have come across. He was
very well prepared and organized. He keeps his sessions very interactive and we spent most of
the time coding rather than looking at the slides or just listening. Moreover, along with the
programming concepts, he also gives you the drive and the thought process to keep doing it after
the training is completed. Thanks Anand for the wonderful training. !!
