The 3 day [Machine Learning Course](/courses/practical-machine-learning) is the perfect session to attend if
you are interested in the field but are still a novice/beginner. Anand
and Amit make a great team and broke down seemingly complex concepts
into simple concepts that was easy to understand for everyone in the
room. The course was really dynamic, in the sense the trainers used
input given to them by the trainees, ran into roadblocks on the way, and
brainstormed with us to come up with means to arrive at a solution. I
feel like this is a better method than the usual way of using an
existing problem and being aware of its potential pitfalls beforehand. I
would highly recommend it to anyone else who wants to learn Machine
Learning and has 3 days to spare.
