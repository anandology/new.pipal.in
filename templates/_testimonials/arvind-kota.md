Anand conducted a a 3 days "Python training" program for the Operations Engineers at
LinkedIn. The training was very much a hands-on approach and solving problems as we learn.
Anand has very deep knowledge on the python internals and was able to break it down to
someone who has very little idea about Python. Given the great feedback from all the Engineers,
We are planning for the Advanced session in March 2015. I would recommend Anand's training
to be a catalyst to learn Python!
